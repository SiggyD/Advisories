# Disclosures

Placeholder Site - Testing underway for using Github pages as a platform for CVE disclosures

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SiggyD/Disclosures/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
